# Zigbee HA Example

Those are the HA (Home Automation) Zigbee devices example. More examples will be coming soon.

## Overview

The folder contains examples demonstrating Zigbee HA standard device

* [HA_on_off_light](HA_on_off_light) is a standard HA on-off light bulb example demonstrating Zigbee End-device. It provides a simple on/off condition for a Zigbee light. It runs on an 802.15.4 SoC like ESP32-H2. For more details see the example readme file.

* [HA_on_off_switch](HA_on_off_switch) is a standard HA on-off switch example demonstrating Zigbee Coordinator role. It provides an on/off toggle to control a Zigbee HA on off light. It runs on an 802.15.4 SoC like ESP32-H2. For more details to see the example readme file.

* [HA_color_dimmable_light](HA_color_dimmable_light) is a standard HA color dimmable light bulb example demonstrating Zigbee End-device. It provides a color dimmable condition for a Zigbee light. It runs on an 802.15.4 SoC like ESP32-H2. For more details see the example readme file.

* [HA_color_dimmable_switch](HA_color_dimmable_switch) is a standard HA color dimmable switch example demonstrating Zigbee Coordinator role. It provides a toggle to control a Zigbee HA color dimmable light to change color and dim light. It runs on an 802.15.4 SoC like ESP32-H2. For more details to see the example readme file.

* [HA_temperature_sensor](HA_temperature_sensor) is a standard HA temperature sensor example demonstrating Zigbee End-device. It provides temperature measurement using the on-chip temperature sensor. It runs on an 802.15.4 SoC like ESP32-H2. For more details see the example readme file.

* [HA_thermostat](HA_thermostat) is a standard HA thermostat example demonstrating Zigbee Coordinator role. It provides temperature acquisition from temperature sensor device with both read and report mechanisms. It runs on an 802.15.4 SoC like ESP32-H2. For more details to see the example readme file.
